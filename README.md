# SparkTree
SparkTree is a Java version of Gradient-Boosted-Tree-Model from Spark. While using Spark to train tree models, we sometimes wants to use it directly in our projects to predict features. However, Spark mllib is not so easy to induce into some projects. So, I develop this module for prediction using Gradient-Boosted-Tree-Model.

Using SparkTree, you could use Gson tools to save json format model, and then read it in simple projects.
